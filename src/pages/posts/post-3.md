It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!

Sometimes I got stuck, but asking for help in the community really made a difference. People were super friendly and willing to assist me with my challenges.

Discworld books are great, by the way. If you haven't read them, I highly recommend starting with "The Colour of Magic." Wait, no, that's a terrible starting point. Try "Guards! Guards!" instead. Much better! Yeah, I know, I'm a nerd.
