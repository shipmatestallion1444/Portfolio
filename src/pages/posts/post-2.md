# Async? Await? Awhat?

Asynchronous programming is a crucial aspect of modern JavaScript development. It allows developers to perform tasks without blocking the main thread, leading to more responsive applications. One of the most popular ways to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript is through the use of `async` and `await`.

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What is Async/Await?

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

Async functions are a special type of function that always return a promise. The `await` keyword can only be used inside async functions and is used to wait for a promise to resolve.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
